# MentalHealthASP
App created to track trends in anxiety and depression using MVC framework

User takes anxiety or depression test used by psychiatrists to get scores
Can then add comments to add information about the day

History page will display all tests that have been taken with the oldest first

Right now would require users to create a local database on their machine and add the change the connection string. 

Future plans: deploy to the cloud and link to cloud database so that it can be used away from my local machine
